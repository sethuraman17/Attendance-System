**Title:** Develop a Call Bot Receptionist for a Dental Hospital

**As a** dental hospital administrator,

8. **Language and Voice Customization:**
   - The bot should support multiple languages if required.
   - The voice should be customizable to match the hospital’s branding.

#### **Technical Requirements:**
